"""Helpers behind the asset browser.

Everything in here is plain data work - reading the addon preferences, keeping
the favourites and recents file, turning the parts definition into a category
tree, filtering, sorting, and working out which slice of it a panel should
show. None of it touches the AssetBrowser property group, which is left to
hold the Blender state and call in here.

Keeping the two apart matters for more than tidiness: most of this runs from
enum item callbacks and panel draw code, where an unhandled exception means a
panel silently renders nothing, so these functions are written to return
something usable rather than to raise.
