"""Rebuild a variant part out of the asset it is a variant of.

Most of the corvette variants shipped in models-high-res are the wrong mesh -
the id says (Y_N) and the asset is something else. What is not wrong is the
relationship between a variant and its root: resources/objects_map.json records,
for every variant, the rigid transform that turns the root's mesh into the
variant's, measured off the assets themselves.

So rather than trusting the variant's own asset, we take the root's asset and
apply that transform to a copy of its mesh. Only variants flagged
``reproducible`` are handled here - the wall tier variants ((BASE)/(MID)/(TOP))
carry a best fit transform that is genuinely a different mesh, and those keep
the asset they ship with.

The transform is in the asset's own stored space (Y up - the library carries a
baked -90 about X), so it applies straight to the mesh, before any of the
object level rotation the builder puts on top.
